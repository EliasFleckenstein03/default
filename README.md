# default (for MineClone2)
The mineclone version of the default mod. It registeres aliases in the default: namespace to their mineclone equivalents, contains the schematics and some of the functions of the default mod.
Many Minetest Mods depend on 'default', even if everything they use default for is a crafting recipe. This mod tries to make these mods available for MineClone2 servers.
